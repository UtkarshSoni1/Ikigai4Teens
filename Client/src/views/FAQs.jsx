                  Ikigai4Teens is a space built to help teenagers figure out what truly excites them and how it connects to real-world careers. It's based on the Japanese idea of Ikigai — finding purpose by combining what you love, what you're good at, and what the world needs. Our platform uses AI to make that process easier and more personal for every teen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Simply put, we help teens discover their passions and strengths, and show them how those can lead to meaningful career paths. Our goal is to give teens the clarity and confidence to shape their future.
